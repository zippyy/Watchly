# Bumped whenever the scoring maths changes, so cached profiles built by older
# code get dropped on read instead of being served with stale numbers until TTL.
# Lives here rather than in profile/constants.py because user_cache reads it, and
# importing anything under app.services.profile pulls in ProfileService via that
# package's __init__ — a cycle.
# v2: Trakt/Simkl items are scored by ScoringService instead of a flat 50.0.
# v3: the sampler sorts by score, so a capped sample is the strongest items
#     rather than an arbitrary slice of the library, and its quota split favours
#     rated titles over watchlist entries.
# v4: Stremio profiles sample up to 200 items instead of 30.
