# Changelog

## 1.14.4 - 2026-09-21

### Fixed

- Migrated Simkl sign-in from the retired AUTH V1 URL to Simkl **AUTH V2** at `/oauth2/authorize`.
- Added required PKCE S256 challenge/verifier handling and validates Simkl's callback issuer and OAuth state.
- Exchanges authorization codes and refresh tokens through `https://api.simkl.com/oauth2/token` using form-encoded AUTH V2 requests.
- Persists Simkl refresh tokens encrypted at rest and automatically refreshes 7-day access tokens before expiry or after a `401`.
- Serializes Simkl refreshes with a Redis lock so concurrent catalog requests cannot invalidate each other's access tokens.
- Simkl API calls now include the current required `client_id`, `app-name`, `app-version`, and `User-Agent` values.
- Added Trakt/Simkl OAuth variables to `.env.example`.

## 1.14.3 - 2026-09-21

### Fixed

- Nuvio Cloud authentication and sync now use the current documented public endpoint, `https://api.nuvio.tv`, instead of the obsolete Supabase project that can return a database-size quota restriction.
- Updated the browser-side Nuvio installer/history connector and the server-side Nuvio history client to use Nuvio's current documented publishable client key.
- The Nuvio backend URL/key remain overrideable through `NUVIO_SUPABASE_URL` and `NUVIO_SUPABASE_KEY` for self-hosted Nuvio deployments.

## 1.14.2 - 2026-09-21

### Added

- Nuvio is now a first-class watch-history source alongside Stremio, Trakt, and Simkl.
- The Accounts page can sign in directly to Nuvio, select a Nuvio profile, and use that profile's synced watched items and playback progress to build Watchly recommendations.
- Nuvio access/refresh tokens are encrypted at rest; the user's Nuvio password is sent directly from the browser to Nuvio and is never submitted to Watchly.
- Nuvio sessions are refreshed automatically when they expire.

### Changed

- Nuvio episode-level watched rows are collapsed to their parent series before scoring so normal episode progression is not mistaken for a series rewatch.
- Stremio logout no longer visually disconnects independently connected Trakt, Simkl, or Nuvio accounts.
- README privacy and integration documentation now distinguishes Nuvio Collection installation from Nuvio history access.

## 1.14.0 - 2026-09-01

### Added

- `ALLOW_SIGNUPS` setting: set it to `False` to lock a public instance to existing accounts. New signups get a 403 and the configure page shows a notice; existing users keep full access (#146).
- The version badge on the configure page opens a changelog popup, with a link to the GitHub releases page.
- Unraid template at `unraid/watchly.xml`, installable via the template URL or by adding the repo under Template Repositories (#154).

### Changed

- Release notes are generated from this changelog (with a commit-message fallback) instead of OpenAI.
- The accounts page presents Stremio, Trakt, and Simkl as equal collapsible cards, without "Recommended"/"Optional" labels.

### Fixed

- Provider logos on the accounts page are proper brand marks inlined into the page; the hot-linked Stremio logo had gone 404.
- Static assets are served with `no-cache` so deploys reach browsers that cached old bundles.
- The Docker build no longer fails on `COPY CHANGELOG.md` — `.dockerignore`'s `*.md` rule was excluding the file the `/changelog` endpoint serves.
- Dropped the stale `GEMINI_API_KEY`/`DEFAULT_GEMINI_MODEL` server env vars from `.env.example` and the README — LLM row naming is configured per user on the configure page.

## 1.13.1 - 2026-08-25 (Sagarmatha)

### Summary

This patch bumps the application to v1.13.1 and includes targeted bug fixes to token handling, improving reliability and security around OAuth tokens.

### Bug Fixes

## 1.13.0 - 2026-08-23 (Sagarmatha Dawn)

### Summary
This release ushers in centralized API error handling, strengthened logging, broader profile sampling, and a broad set of performance improvements. It also simplifies the homepage UI by removing the taste-profile card and applies several domain and data fixes. Version 1.13.0 carries a Nepal-inspired name to celebrate new heights: Sagarmatha Dawn.

### Features
- Centralized API error handling: errors are now managed in one place rather than at each endpoint, reducing duplication and improving consistency.
- Enhanced logging: configure Loguru, tag every log line with a request ID, and suppress sensitive credentials from tracebacks for safer, cleaner logs.
- Warm-up progress visibility: users see warm-up progress before handing over the final URL, improving perceived readiness.
- Profile sampling expansion: sampling increased from 30 items to up to 200 library items for richer, more accurate taste profiles.
- Homepage simplification: removed the taste-profile feature card to streamline the landing experience.

### Improvements
- Config UI refinement: the saved-key marker is replaced with a fingerprint display for clearer identification.
- Profile workflow enhancements:
  - Sampling quota is weighted toward rated titles to better reflect user preferences.
  - Strongest items are prioritized during sampling instead of an arbitrary slice.
  - Incremental, two-source change-detection mechanism improves efficiency.
  - Trakt/Simkl items are now scored with the real scorer, improving accuracy and consistency.
  - Reuse unchanged Trakt/Simkl taste profiles to avoid unnecessary recomputation.

### Performance Enhancements
- Catalogs: serve stable slot IDs to prevent unnecessary refreshes caused by shifting slots; refresh behind the response for smoother UX.
- Catalogs: serve stale rows immediately and refresh in the background to keep data fresh without blocking.
- Install: warm accounts in the background and cache the manifest for faster initial access.
- Cache: compress large per-user cache values to reduce memory and bandwidth.
- Manifest handling: drop the manifest when all user data is invalidated to avoid stale metadata.
- Watch history handling: page through the entire Trakt watch history to ensure complete data retrieval.

### Bug Fixes

### Summary
Release 1.4.3 delivers data integrity improvements and performance enhancements. It includes fixes to metadata cleaning to only include valid IMDb IDs, improved handling to avoid using TMDB IDs as final metadata, better item fetching when genres are excluded, and a caching improvement to speed up catalog loading.

### Improvements
- Cache catalogs for 6 hours to speed startup and reduce repeated fetches. (#123)

### Bug Fixes
- Ensure only valid IMDb IDs are returned during metadata cleaning, preventing invalid IDs from polluting data. (#123)
- Remove items that improperly use TMDB IDs as final metadata to ensure data consistency and correct linking. (#123)
- When genres are excluded, fetch more items to maintain catalog completeness and accuracy (refs: #79). (#123)
